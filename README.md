# Redesign Project

## By **Travis Toal**

## Target Users

* _Potential coworkers can get a feeling of openness - both physical and mental - from the site, and can get information about how to join the workspace. Minimal text-blocks and stuff in your face._

* _Local workers can tell that the company is not soulless, but warm, quirky, and connected to their Portland roots - definitely not your traditional corporation._

* _Non-technical folk will feel welcome and represented in the company, as opposed to a code-focused site._

* _Potential clients can see the many modern amenities and luxuries the company has, and the group activities they would have access to if they join the space._
