# Design Project

#### Mock website design based on example client desires

## By **Travis Toal**

## Description

* _This project is an exercise in the design process, from defining the target users, to creating wireframes, to navigable prototypes, and finally to a coded, live site._

## Target Users

* _Potential coworkers can get a feeling of openness - both physical and mental - from the site, and can get information about how to join the workspace. Minimal text-blocks and stuff in your face. It feels high-end, but not exclusive._

* _The clients' personalities are reflected in the site - the company is not soulless, but warm, quirky, and connected to their Portland roots - definitely not your traditional corporation._

* _Non-technical folk will feel welcome and represented in the company, as opposed to a code-focused site._

* _Social clients can see the many modern amenities and luxuries the company has, and the group activities they would have access to if they join the space._
